# Tekken-8-Movesetswap
A small CheatEngine Table to swap the movesets of P1 and P2

How to use:

1. Download & Install cheat engine here https://www.cheatengine.org/
   You don't need admin rights to use it.
2. Start Tekken 8, select the Tekken 8 process and open the file v20301-Moveset.CT.
3. In Tekken 8 choose any mode and character till you reach the map selection screen.
4. In Cheat engine change the moveset of Left Side and/or Right Side in the lower left corner below the button memory view.
   The Value defines the moveset e.g. 6 is Jin and 14 Lili. When you click on the value a dropdown will open.
5. If you want to switch the characters deactivate the moveset before exiting the menu after the match, otherwise the game could crash.

Notes:
This is just working for the current version 2.03.01 of Tekken 8.
1. It is very likely i have to update the table at a new update.
2. If you choose a DLC char Paul (because default 00) will be shown during the loading screen, but if you "activate" by ticking the left X the moveset of the DLC-char will be activ.
3. I always go offline in steam before i open cheat engine. I recommend to do the same. Also don't forget to quit cheat engine when you stop using it as other programs like Anticheat software don't like it for obvious reasons ;-)
