# Tekken-8-Movesetswap
A small CheatEngine Table to swap the movesets of P1 and P2

How to use:

1. Download & Install cheat engine here https://www.cheatengine.org/
   You don't need admin rights to use it.
2. Start Tekken 8, select the Tekken 8 process and open the file Movesetswap-v-2-0.CT.
3. In Tekken 8 choose any mode and character till you reach the map selection screen.
4. Now change the moveset of P1 and P2 in the lower left corner below the button memory view.
   The Value defines the moveset e.g. 6 is Jin and 14 Lili. When you click on the value a dropdown will open.
5. If you want to switch the characters deactivate the moveset before exiting the menu after the match, otherwise the game could crash.

Notes:
This is just working for the current version 2.0 of Tekken 8.
• It is very likely i have to update the table at a new update.
• If you choose a DLC char Paul (because default 00) will be shown during the loadin screen, but if you "activate" by ticking the left X the moveset of the DLC-char will be activ.
